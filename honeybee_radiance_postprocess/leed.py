    Args:
        results: Path to results folder or a Results class object.
        grids_filter: The name of a grid or a pattern to filter the grids.
            Defaults to '*'.
        shade_transmittance: A value to use as a multiplier in place of solar
            shading. This input can be either a single value that will be used
            for all aperture groups, or a dictionary where aperture groups are
            keys, and the value for each key is the shade transmittance. Values
            for shade transmittance must be 1 > value > 0.
            Defaults to 0.05.
        states_schedule: A custom dictionary of shading states. In case this is
            left empty, the function will calculate a shading schedule by using
            the shade_transmittance input. If a states schedule is provided it
            will check that it is complying with the 2% rule. Defaults to None.
        threshold: Threshold value for daylight autonomy. Default: 300.
        direct_threshold: The threshold that determines if a sensor is overlit.
            Defaults to 1000.
        occ_hours: The number of occupied hours that cannot receive more than
            the direct_threshold. Defaults to 250.
        target_time: A minimum threshold of occupied time (eg. 50% of the
            time), above which a given sensor passes and contributes to the
            spatial daylight autonomy. Defaults to 50.
        sub_folder: Relative path for a subfolder to write the output. If None,
            the files will not be written. Defaults to None.

    Returns:
        Tuple:
        -   summary: Summary of all grids combined.
        -   summary_grid: Summary of each grid individually.
        -   da_grids: List of daylight autonomy values for each grid. Each item
                in the list is a NumPy array of DA values.
        -   hours_above: List of hours above 1000 direct illuminance (with
                default states) for each grid. Each item in the list is a NumPy
                array of hours above 1000 lux.
        -   states_schedule: A dictionary of annual shading schedules for each
                aperture group.
